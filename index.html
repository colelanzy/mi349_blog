        <h2>Michigan State Hockey Victory</h2>
        <p><b>Published:</b> October 13, 2024 | <b>Author:</b> Cole Lanzinger</p>
        <p>
            On Saturday, October 12th the Michigan State Spartans Hockey team faced the Boston College Eagles.
            Prior to this game, the Spartans look a hard 3-0 loss to the Eagles at Munn, their home arena. This
            one hurt, as it was our home opener as well. Fortunately, I was not at that game. I was however, in
            attendance on Saturday. The Spartans took an early 1-0 lead, but Boston College fought back and ended
            the first period in the lead, 2-1.
        </p>
        <p>
            Early in the second period, Boston College scored another goal,
            putting them up 3-1. After his, the Spartans went on an impressive 3-goal run, reclaiming the lead,
            4-3. Then in the third quarter, both sides were scoreless, leading to a 4-3 victory for Michigan State!
            The atmosphere was electric, with the Munnsters (Michigan State's student section) consistently
            cheering proudly.
        </p>
        <p> It was a great game to experience, and I am looking forward to my next game. This win
            was especially important because Michigan State was ranked 4th in the nation, and Boston College was
            ranked 2nd. The Spartans' next match up will be against Windsor (Ont.), back at Munn Ice Arena again.
            Hopefully I will be able to get some tickets and go cheer them on again! Go Green!

        <h2>Cabo Spring Break</h2>
        <p><b>Published:</b> October 13, 2024 | <b>Author:</b> Cole Lanzinger</p>
        <p>
            Last year (my junior year), me and a bunch of my friends spent our spring break in Cabo San Lucas,
            Mexico. One of my friends lives in Chicago, and the cheapest flights we could find were at O'Hare,
            so we chose to drive to Chicago the night prior to our flight and stay with him. We were all very
            excited, with all of our luggage and passports ready to go. We all hung out there for the night,
            then woke up early the next morning to get to the airport.
        </p>
        <p>
            We had to take a few trips to the airport, as there were 12 of us going. On the way out of the house,
            something terrible happened. We were all joking around showing each other our passport pictures, when
            somebody noticed that my friends passport was expired! There wasn't anything we could do for him, and
            unfortunately we had to leave him behind and head to the airport. This put a short damper on the trip,
            but now that time has passed it is just a funny memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we got to Cabo, and got through customs, we instantly walked into a vacation environment. Right
            outside the airport, there were multiple tiki-style bars, shops, and all the shuttles to take
            visitors to their resorts. We had a look around then took a ~45 minute bus ride to our resort.
            We all instantly loved the resort. We were greeted with glasses of champagne and immediate access to
            all-inclusive dining and drinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            We spent the great majority of the time we were there sitting in a pool with a swim-up bar, enjoying
            the views, the perfect weather, and the many dining options. There were also many events at the resort
            daily. We played in a beach soccer tournament and a beach volleyball tournament, which were a lot of
            fun. We are planning on repeating the same trip again this year, for our senior year spring break. It
            is almost a no-brainer to go back, as the was relatively cheap (~$600 for 5 nights all-inclusive), and
            we all had a great time (excluding the one who had an expired passport). Highly recommend the Riu Santa
            Fe!
