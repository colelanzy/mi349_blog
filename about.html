            Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Cole, and I am currently studying Computer Science at
            Michigan State University. I am a senior, looking to finish off my MSU experience the best I can.
            I love going to Michigan State's athletic events, especially basketball, hockey, and football.
            Especially with it being my senior year, I am trying to go to as many events as possible! So far
            this year, I have been to every home football game, one hockey game, and the Pistons' preseason
            game at the Breslin. I can't wait for the basketball season, it is my favorite MSU sport to watch.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also love travelling, and I try to travel as much as I can on a college kid's budget.
            So far, only considering out-of-country destinations, I have been to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Toronto, Canada</li>
            <li>Blue Mountains, Canada</li>
            <li>Niagara Falls, Canada</li>
            <li>Cabo San Lucas, Mexico</li>
            <li>Cozumel, Mexico</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I am hoping to lengthen that list soon, and I am also planning on returning to a few of those
            destinations this year. So that's a little bit about me... enjoy my blog!
